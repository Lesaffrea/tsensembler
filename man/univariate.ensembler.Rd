\title{Learning a Dynamic Ensemble for Time Series Forecasting}
\usage{
univariate.ensembler(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An object of class \code{tsensembler}.}
}
\value{
A predictive model ensemble of class \code{tseModel}.
}
\description{
This is the implementation of the learning procedure of the ensemble method.
The application is run on an object of class \code{tsensembler}, which provide
the options about how the ensemble should be construct such as: the embedding
dimension; the number of Monte Carlo repetitions, etc.
This method differs from \code{gs.ensembler} in the fact that \emph{ensembler}
does not estimate several models. \emph{ensembler} simply trains an Dynamic
Ensemble according to the specs in the object \strong{obj} of class \code{tsensembler}.
