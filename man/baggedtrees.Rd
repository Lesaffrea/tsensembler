\description{
baggedtrees with different embedding dimensions and summary statistics.
This function trains a bagging ensemble of trees using rpart package implementation
of decision trees. BaggingDEp_S differs from BaggingE by using different
representations of the series. This is accomplished by using
different embedding dimensions within the ensemble. With this
property the goal is to encourage diversity into the ensemble
so to reduce the variance in the combined model.
This model is based on the work done by Oliveira and Torgo (2014)
